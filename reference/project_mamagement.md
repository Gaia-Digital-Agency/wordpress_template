## The 10-Phase Project Lifecycle

### Overview

Every WordPress project progresses through these sequential phases:

```
Phase 1     Phase 2      Phase 3       Phase 4        Phase 5
Discovery → Planning  →  Design    →  Environment →  Backend
(2 days)    (1.5 days)   (3 days)      (1 day)        (4 days)

Phase 6     Phase 7      Phase 8       Phase 9        Phase 10
Frontend → Content   →  Testing   →  UAT        →  Launch
(4 days)   (1.5 days)   (2 days)      (0.5 days)     (0.5 days)
```

### Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Duration | % Effort | Key Deliverable | Gate Criteria |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **1. Discovery & Requirements** | 2 days | 10% | Requirements Document | Client sign-off on scope |
| **2. Planning & Architecture** | 1.5 days | 8% | Technical Specification | Approved architecture plan |
| **3. Design** | 3 days | 15% | Visual Mockups | Client design approval |
| **4. Environment Setup** | 1 day | 5% | Staging Site | WordPress accessible |
| **5. Backend Development** | 4 days | 20% | Functional Site | All features working |
| **6. Frontend Development** | 4 days | 20% | Complete Pages | Responsive implementation |
| **7. Content Population** | 1.5 days | 7% | Populated Site | Content + SEO complete |
| **8. Testing** | 2 days | 10% | QA Report | All tests passed |
| **9. User Acceptance Testing** | 0.5 days | 3% | Client Approval | UAT sign-off |
| **10. Deployment & Launch** | 0.5 days | 2% | Live Site | Site live + handover |

## Project Control Framework

### Status Workflow

Each task progresses through these statuses:

```
Backlog → To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done
                       ↓
                    Blocked
```

**Status Definitions:**
- **Backlog:** Future work, not yet scheduled
- **To Do:** Scheduled for current phase
- **In Progress:** Actively being worked on
- **In Review:** Awaiting review/approval
- **Blocked:** Waiting on external dependency
- **Done:** Completed and approved

### Priority System

| Priority | Definition | Response Time | Use Case |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Blocks progress or client deadline | Same day | Launch blockers, client-facing issues |
| **High** | Important for phase completion | Within 2 days | Core features, key functionality |
| **Medium** | Standard development work | Within current phase | Regular tasks |
| **Low** | Nice-to-have enhancements | End of project | Optional improvements |

### Quality Gates

Projects cannot advance to the next phase without passing the gate:

**Gate Requirements:**
1. ✅ All phase tasks marked "Done"
2. ✅ Deliverable approved by reviewer
3. ✅ Client sign-off obtained (if required)
4. ✅ No critical blockers
5. ✅ Handoff meeting completed

## Client Management

### Client Touchpoint Schedule

```
Week 1              Week 2            Week 3            Week 4
│                   │                 │                 │
▼                   ▼                 ▼                 ▼
Kickoff Call        Design Review     Progress Update   UAT & Launch
```

### Client-Facing Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Client Action Required | Deliverable |
|------|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Kickoff Call | Provide requirements, content | Requirements sign-off |
| **Week 2** | Design Review | Approve mockups | Design approval |
| **Week 3** | Progress Demo | Review functionality | Feedback |
| **Week 4** | UAT Session | Final testing, training | Launch approval |

### Communication Protocol

**Discovery Phase (Days 1-2):**
- Day 1: Kickoff call scheduled
- Day 2: Requirements gathered
- Gate: Cannot proceed without signed requirements

**Design Phase (Days 5-8):**
- Day 5-6: Design work (internal)
- Day 7: Design presentation
- Day 8: Feedback incorporated
- Gate: Design approval required

**UAT Phase (Day 19):**
- UAT session conducted
- Punch list created
- Gate: Final sign-off required for launch

## Team Management

### The 6-Developer Model

**Team Structure:**

| Role | Developer | Specialization | Capacity |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Lead** | Dev 1 | Full-stack, mentoring | 1 complex project + oversight |
| **Frontend** | Dev 2, 3 | Page building, responsive design | 2 projects each |
| **Backend** | Dev 4, 5 | WooCommerce, integrations | 1-2 projects each |
| **QA** | Dev 6 | Testing, performance | All 6 projects |

### Resource Allocation Matrix

| Project Type | Lead Developer | Support Developer | QA Coverage |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| E-Commerce | Dev 4 (BE/Ecom) | Dev 1 (Lead) | Dev 6 |
| Corporate | Dev 1 (Lead) | Dev 2 (FE) | Dev 6 |

## Risk Management

### Common Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Client Delayed Approvals** | Project timeline slip | Set clear deadlines, escalate early |
| **Scope Creep** | Resource overrun | Strict change control, phase gates |
| **Technical Blockers** | Development delays | Daily standup visibility, pair programming |
| **Resource Conflicts** | Quality issues | Developer assignment matrix, lead oversight |
| **Third-Party Delays** | Integration failures | Early validation, backup plans |

### Escalation Path

1. **Developer identifies blocker** → Raises in daily standup
2. **PM assesses impact** → Assigns priority
3. **Resolution attempt** → Team collaboration (24 hours)
4. **Escalation if unresolved** → Lead developer involvement
5. **Critical escalation** → Client communication + timeline adjustment

---

## Scaling Considerations

### Adding More Projects (7+)

**Option 1: Add Developers**
- Add 1 developer = +1 project capacity
- Maintain role balance (FE, BE, QA ratio)

**Option 2: Extend Timeline**
- 25-day cycle = reduced pressure
- 30-day cycle = higher quality threshold

### Customizing Phase Duration

**E-Commerce Projects:**
- Extend Backend phase (+2 days)
- Extended Testing phase (+1 day)
- Total: 23 days

**Portfolio/Static Projects:**
- Reduce Backend phase (-1 day)
- Extend Design phase (+1 day)
- Total: 20 days
